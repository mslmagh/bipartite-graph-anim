# ðŸŽ¥ Bipartite Graph Visualization with Manim

This project demonstrates the concept of **Bipartite Graphs** using the Python animation engine **Manim**.  
The animation visually walks through the process of verifying whether a graph is bipartite by attempting to color nodes in two colors without conflicts.

## ðŸ§  What is a Bipartite Graph?

A **bipartite graph** is a graph whose nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets such that **no two nodes in the same set are adjacent**.  
This animation shows:
- A graph with 6 nodes and several edges
- A step-by-step coloring process (Black and White)
- Visual conflict detection when a node cannot be properly colored
